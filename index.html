 I love to meet new people and learn about their culture. I love to eat good food and try new things. 
 I love to listen to music and dance. I love to read books and watch movies. I love to spend time with my family and friends. I love to help others and make a difference in the world. 
 I love to learn new things and grow as a person. I love to be happy and enjoy life.</p>
</br> 
<P>I also like helping others whenever I can. I seek to be a missionary some day! 
Spreading the Word gives me unspeakable joy,to brighten others day! The Good News Of The Gospel Of Yahusha Ha'Mashiach, brings the LIGHT unto the world!
I am a firm believer in the Word of Yahuah and I believe that we are all called to be a light unto the world. 
I believe that we are all called to be a blessing to others. I believe that we are all called to make a difference in the world.
